## General Information
- Background: The project focuses on analyzing data from a financial institution to understand the factors that contribute to loan default. This analysis will help in refining loan approval strategies and reducing the risk of non-payment.
- Business Problem: The key business problem is to identify the factors that increase the likelihood of loan default, thus enabling the lender to make informed decisions during the loan approval process. The objective is to minimize the risk associated with lending and improve the overall profitability.
- Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis consists of loan applications, including details such as loan amount, interest rate, term, grade, employment length, home ownership status, annual income, and loan status among others.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: Loans with shorter terms (36 months) tend to have a higher likelihood of being fully paid compared to longer-term loans (60 months).
- Conclusion 2: Borrowers with lower grades (e.g., D, E, F, G) have a higher chance of defaulting on their loans compared to those with higher grades (A, B).
- Conclusion 3: Interest rates above 15% are correlated with a higher probability of loan default.
- Conclusion 4: Public Records of Bankruptcies and Purpose are significant indicators of loan repayment behavior.
